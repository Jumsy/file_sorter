This program has been tested on python 3.2.2

To run:
  Execute the file while the current working directory is the directory of
  files that you wish to sort.

This program assumes that feh, mplayer, chromium and animate are installed.
It also assumes that your target destinations for files mirrors my file system.
Other people wishing to use this program will either have to use the same
file system as I do or manually edit the target destiniations in the source file
